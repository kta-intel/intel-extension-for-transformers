## ðŸŒŸIntroduction
IntelÂ® Extension for Transformers is an innovative toolkit designed to accelerate GenAI/LLM everywhere with the optimal performance of Transformer-based models on various Intel platforms, including Intel Gaudi2, Intel CPU, and Intel GPU. The toolkit provides the below key features and examples:

*  Seamless user experience of model compressions on Transformer-based models by extending [Hugging Face transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)Â APIs and leveraging [IntelÂ® Neural Compressor](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor)

*  Advanced software optimizations and unique compression-aware runtime (released with NeurIPS 2022's paper [Fast Distilbert on CPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07715) and [QuaLA-MiniLM: a Quantized Length Adaptive MiniLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17114), and NeurIPS 2021's paper [Prune Once for All: Sparse Pre-Trained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05754))

<!-- *  Optimized Transformer-based model packages such as [Stable Diffusion](examples/huggingface/pytorch/text-to-image/deployment/stable_diffusion), [GPT-J-6B](examples/huggingface/pytorch/text-generation/deployment), [GPT-NEOX](examples/huggingface/pytorch/language-modeling/quantization#2-validated-model-list), [BLOOM-176B](examples/huggingface/pytorch/language-modeling/inference#BLOOM-176B), [T5](examples/huggingface/pytorch/summarization/quantization#2-validated-model-list), [Flan-T5](examples/huggingface/pytorch/summarization/quantization#2-validated-model-list), and end-to-end workflows such as [SetFit-based text classification](docs/tutorials/pytorch/text-classification/SetFit_model_compression_AGNews.ipynb) and [document level sentiment analysis (DLSA)](workflows/dlsa)  -->

*  [NeuralChat](intel_extension_for_transformers/neural_chat), a customizable chatbot framework to create your own chatbot within minutes by leveraging a rich set of [plugins](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-transformers/blob/main/intel_extension_for_transformers/neural_chat/docs/advanced_features.md) such as [Knowledge Retrieval](./intel_extension_for_transformers/neural_chat/pipeline/plugins/retrieval/README.md), [Speech Interaction](./intel_extension_for_transformers/neural_chat/pipeline/plugins/audio/README.md), [Query Caching](./intel_extension_for_transformers/neural_chat/pipeline/plugins/caching/README.md), and [Security Guardrail](./intel_extension_for_transformers/neural_chat/pipeline/plugins/security/README.md). This framework supports Intel Gaudi2/CPU/GPU.

*  [Inference](https://github.com/intel/neural-speed/tree/main) of Large Language Model (LLM) in pure C/C++ with weight-only quantization kernels for Intel CPU and Intel GPU (TBD), supporting [GPT-NEOX](https://github.com/intel/neural-speed/tree/main/neural_speed/models/gptneox), [LLAMA](https://github.com/intel/neural-speed/tree/main/neural_speed/models/llama), [MPT](https://github.com/intel/neural-speed/tree/main/neural_speed/models/mpt), [FALCON](https://github.com/intel/neural-speed/tree/main/neural_speed/models/falcon), [BLOOM-7B](https://github.com/intel/neural-speed/tree/main/neural_speed/models/bloom), [OPT](https://github.com/intel/neural-speed/tree/main/neural_speed/models/opt), [ChatGLM2-6B](https://github.com/intel/neural-speed/tree/main/neural_speed/models/chatglm), [GPT-J-6B](https://github.com/intel/neural-speed/tree/main/neural_speed/models/gptj), and [Dolly-v2-3B](https://github.com/intel/neural-speed/tree/main/neural_speed/models/gptneox). Support AMX, VNNI, AVX512F and AVX2 instruction set. We've boosted the performance of Intel CPUs, with a particular focus on the 4th generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor, codenamed [Sapphire Rapids](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/xeon-accelerated/4th-gen-xeon-scalable-processors.html).
